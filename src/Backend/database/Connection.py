"""
you can also think of connection as requests to the database, 
if we dont close the connection at the end the connection will stay open 
and besides it taking up memeory once we reach 100 requested connections to the database, postgres will start to reject 
ecause each prev connection stays alive and within the database so we need to close the connection everytime we open it
